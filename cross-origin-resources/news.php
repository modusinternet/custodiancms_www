		2023-12-15: The latest version of Custodian CMS, v0.7.9, was released today.  Been pretty busy this year so I did not get a lot of time to work on this project but collectively there was enough done in the /user/ folder I felt it was time to generate a new release. Happy Holidays guys.

		2022-04-12: The latest version of Custodian CMS, v0.7.8, was released today.  This one was a minor update necessary to fix an issue with the noindex/canonical reference on the homepage when used in combination with the caching system.

		2022-03-31: The latest version of Custodian CMS, v0.7.7, was released today.  It can be downloaded at <a href="https://github.com/modusinternet/Custodian-CMS/releases/tag/v0.7.7" target="_blank">Github</a>.  This work has helped set the overall look and feel of what the full admin system will be like eventually. I've added proper dropdown responses for specific actions throughout and integrated the user privileges into all areas of the admin and public sides of the example templates, for the purpose of editing.  Special thanks goes out to JoAnn Mix of Edmonton, Alberta for her time and patients while helping me QA test everything found in this release. (Thanks Mom, XX/OO)

		2022-01-21: Updates to the User/Dashboard area have been evolving over the past month with great success.  I hope to release the next version of Custodian CMS within the week.

		2022-01-03: I would like to thank the Custodian CMS (CCMS) developers for all their hard work and contributions in 2021.  They tirelessly worked, throughout the year, to help improve the functionality and stability of the CCMS ecosystem as the entire world around us seemingly imploded.  I would also like to extend my appreciation to the users of CCMS for their continued support. It's been a challenging year for many and I just wanted to acknowledge this fact. I hope everyone had a happy holiday and wish you all the best in 2022!<br>
		Sincerly,<br>
		Vincent Hallberg<br>
		(Founder and lead developer of Custodian CMS)
